Adds spikes `s` to an existing sequence event, to a new sequence event,

For each sequence event k = 1 ... K, we compute

The probability of forming a new cluster is

    prob[K + 1] propto p(x_i | z_i = K + 1) * alpha * (V(K + 1) / V(K))

where p(x_i | z_i = K + 1) is the marginal probability of a singleton cluster.
See section 6 of Miller & Harrison (2018).

The probability of the background is

where lambda0 = m.bkgd_rate and (alpha, beta) are the shape and 
rate parameters of the gamma prior on sequence event amplitudes.
