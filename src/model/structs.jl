Summary information for latent events. See `SeqEvent` for
the full-featured struct that caches things like sufficient
statistics. This summary holds the basic information that
is saved during MCMC sampling and output to the user.

assignment_id :

    Integer specifying the cluster id. Corresponds to
    the `indices` in `SeqEventList` struct.

timestamp :

    Time that the latent event occured. See
    `sampled_timestamp` in `SeqEvent`.

seq_type :

    Integer in {1, 2, ..., R} specifying the sequence
    type. See `sampled_type` in `SeqEvent` struct.

seq_warp:
    
    Float in [1/τ, ..., τ] specifying the inferred warp
    of the sequence.  See `sampled_warp` in `SeqEvent`;
    here we report the warp value rather than its index.

amplitude :

    Sampled amplitude of the latent event (i.e. the
    expected number of evoked spikes). See
    `sampled_amplitude` in `SeqEvent` struct.

    sequence-evoked spikes across neurons.

neuron_response_log_proportions :
    N × R matrix, each column is a log-probability vector over
    neurons. Element (n, r) is proportional to the response
    amplitude of neuron n to sequences of type r. Column r is

Holds sufficient statistics needed to estimate the time,
amplitude, and type of a sequence occurence / latent event.

Parameters
----------
spike_count :
    Number of spikes assigned to this sequence.

summed_potentials :
   g Size RxW matrix, element (r,w) stores,

        Σᵢ mᵢ

        where mᵢ = (tᵢ - b_{nᵢ,r} * τ_w) / (c_{nᵢ,r} * τ_w)

    where the sum is over spikes (tᵢ, nᵢ) assigned to
    this sequence event. The parameters b_{r,nᵢ} and
    c_{r,nᵢ} correspond to the response offset and width
    of neuron nᵢ to sequences of type r, and they are each
    linearly scaled by the warp value τ_w.

summed_precisions :
    Size RxW matrix, element (r,w) stores,

        Σᵢ vᵢ

        where vᵢ = 1 / (c_{nᵢ,r} * τ_w)

    where the sum is over spikes (tᵢ, nᵢ) assigned to
    this sequence event. The parameter c_{r,nᵢ}
    corresponds to the response width of neuron nᵢ
    to sequences of type r, and it is linearly scaled
    by the warp value τ_w.

summed_logZ:
    Size RxW matrix, element (r,w) stores,

        Σᵢ log[ a_{nᵢ,r} / Z(mᵢ, vᵢ) ]

    where the sum is over spikes (tᵢ, nᵢ) assigned to
    this sequence event. The parameter a_{nᵢ,r} is
    the response amplitude of neuron nᵢ to sequences
    of type r. The term `Z(mᵢ, vᵢ)` denotes the log
    normalization constant for a univariate Gaussian
    with precision `vᵢ` and potential `mᵢ`.  Note that
    the precision and linear potentials depend on τ_w.

    TODO: This naming convention is a little strange
    since we're really storing log a -log Z.

seq_type_posterior:
    Size RxW matrix, element (r,w) is proportional to:

        Σᵢ(log a_{nᵢ,r} - Σᵢ log Z(mᵢ, vᵢ)) + log Z(Σᵢ mᵢ, Σᵢ vᵢ)

    After normalization, the represents the posterior distribution
    over the event sequence type and warp value, given the spikes 
    currently assigned to this event.

sampled_type :
    The current type of the event (changes over
    Gibbs samples).

sampled_warp:
    The current warp index of the event (changes over
    Gibbs samples).

sampled_timestamp :
    The current time of the event (changes over
    Gibbs samples).

sampled_amplitude :
    The current amplitude of the event (changes over
    Gibbs samples).
